# Loggy

## Goal

The goal is it to build a SaaS for logging and monitoring web applications that can handle large amounts of data. Centralizing logs and errors enables developers to get new insights into their applications and draw connections between different events.

## Motivation

I'm developing this app to get a better understanding of Go and its internals. It should also help me to acquire experience in Google Cloud.
